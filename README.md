## A Simple DHCP Server & Client

### Client Side Implementation:
+ DHCP Discover
+ DHCP Request
+ Fake a MAC Address
+ Get MAC Address directly from computer interface

### Server Side Implementation:
+ DHCP Offer
+ DHCP ACK
+ DHCP NAK

### Caution
+ Maybe need super user ( like: root ) to use port 67,68
+ Fake IP function is just a toy ....
